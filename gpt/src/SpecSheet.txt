Spec SheetDevice Name: Smart Temperature Controller
Description: A device designed to regulate the temperature of an environment by controlling
heating and cooling systems based on user-defined settings.
Specifications
Inputs:
● Current Temperature Sensor: Measures ambient temperature (Range: -40°C to
125°C).
● Target Temperature: User-defined setting (Range: 0°C to 100°C).
● Mode Selector: User can switch between Heating and Cooling modes.
Outputs:
● Heating System Control: Activates or deactivates the heating system.
● Cooling System Control: Activates or deactivates the cooling system.
● Status Indicators: LEDs or display indicators for system status:
○ Heating: Indicates heating system is active.
○ Cooling: Indicates cooling system is active.
○ Idle: Indicates no active heating or cooling.
Functional Requirements:
1. Temperature Regulation:
○ Heating Mode:
■ Activate heating when Current Temperature is at least 0.5°C below
Target Temperature.
■ Deactivate heating when Current Temperature reaches or exceeds
Target Temperature.
○ Cooling Mode:
■ Activate cooling when Current Temperature is at least 0.5°C above
Target Temperature.
■ Deactivate cooling when Current Temperature reaches or drops
below Target Temperature.
2. Hysteresis Threshold:
○ A default hysteresis of 0.5°C to prevent rapid on/off cycling.
3. Safety Features:
○ Overheat Protection:
■ If Current Temperature exceeds 120°C, shut down systems and
trigger an alarm.
○ Sensor Failure Detection:
■ Detect and handle out-of-range or erratic sensor readings by entering
a safe mode and notifying the user.
Non-Functional Requirements:
● Response Time: System must respond to input changes within 1 second.
● Power Efficiency: Minimize power consumption in Idle mode.
● User Interface: Provide a simple interface for setting the Target Temperature and
Mode.
● Communication Interface: Optional Wi-Fi module for remote monitoring and control.
